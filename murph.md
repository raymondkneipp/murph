# 🏋️ Murph Workout App – Actionable Checklist

## 1️⃣ Core Workout Tracking

**Objective:** Let users log their Murph workouts and resume if interrupted.

* [ ] Define **Murph workout schema** (mile, pull-ups, push-ups, squats, weighted vest, timestamps).
* [ ] Implement **state persistence**:

  * Local storage (for immediate save & resume)
  * Optionally, remote database for logged-in users.
* [ ] Auto-save workout progress every few reps or seconds.
* [ ] Restore saved workout if user reloads or navigates away.
* [ ] Handle **scaling options**:

  * Half Murph
  * Weighted vest optional
  * Run substitutions (row, bike)

---

## 2️⃣ Workout UI/UX

* [ ] Design **progress tracking interface** (show mile completed, reps done, remaining).
* [ ] Include **start/pause/resume buttons**.
* [ ] Optional: show timers or pacing suggestions.
* [ ] Display motivational indicators (streaks, personal best, milestones).

---

## 3️⃣ User Accounts & Authentication

**Objective:** Enable social and personalized features.

* [ ] User signup/login system.
* [ ] Profile page for:

  * Personal stats
  * Murph history
  * Streaks & milestones
* [ ] Option to **store workouts privately or share with followers**.

---

## 4️⃣ Social Features

**Objective:** Encourage community and engagement.

* [ ] Implement **search and follow** system.
* [ ] Design **user feed**:

  * Followers’ recent Murphs
  * Optional global feed (top performers)
* [ ] Privacy controls:

  * Public / followers-only / private workouts
* [ ] Implement **comments/encouragements** on workouts.
* [ ] Optional: notifications when a followed user completes a workout.

---

## 5️⃣ Progress & Gamification

* [ ] Track **personal streaks and milestones**:

  * Consecutive Murph days
  * Total pull-ups, push-ups, squats, miles
* [ ] Visualize progress:

  * Charts/graphs for reps over time
  * Personal best leaderboard
* [ ] Badges/avatars/gear for achievements (weighted vest milestones, streaks).
* [ ] Optional: Challenges:

  * Individual or group
  * Track progress collectively

---

## 6️⃣ Optional Enhancements

* [ ] **Murph leaderboard**:

  * Daily/weekly/monthly top times
  * Optional anonymized public leaderboard
* [ ] **Workout notes**:

  * Users can log tips or feelings for each Murph
* [ ] **Export / Share feature**:

  * Share workout stats to social media or as image summary
* [ ] **Theming / Logo**:

  * Implement SVG logos and app branding (we have logo pack ready)

---

## 7️⃣ Technical & Performance Considerations

* [ ] Choose data storage:

  * SQLite for local storage / server database for synced accounts
  * Store images or avatars as files or BLOBs (avoid base64 in DB if possible)
* [ ] Optimize **sync frequency** to avoid unnecessary writes
* [ ] Mobile-friendly responsive design

---

## ✅ Suggested Implementation Order

1. Core workout schema + local storage + progress tracking (most important).
2. Workout UI with start/pause/resume + visualization.
3. User accounts/login + optional remote storage.
4. Social features: follow/search + feed + privacy controls.
5. Streaks, milestones, charts, and gamification.
6. Optional enhancements (leaderboards, notes, sharing).
7. Branding, logos, and final theming.

If you want, I can **turn this into a visually structured roadmap** with **milestones, features, and dependencies** — basically a developer’s checklist that you can tick off as you implement. It would be perfect for keeping the project organized and manageable.

Do you want me to do that?



Perfect 👌 — the **Geolocation API in web** can absolutely handle this. Here’s how you’d structure it for a Murph workout 1-mile run:

---

## ✅ Basic Flow with Geolocation API

1. **Ask permission** to use location.
2. **Start tracking** with `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()`.
3. Record each GPS coordinate with a timestamp.
4. **Calculate distance traveled** by summing the distances between coordinates (Haversine formula).
5. Stop tracking once distance ≥ 1.0 miles.

---

## 🧩 Example Code (Vanilla JS)

```js
let watchId;
let totalDistance = 0;
let lastPosition = null;

function toRad(deg) {
  return deg * Math.PI / 180;
}

// Haversine distance in meters
function haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const R = 6371000; // Earth radius in meters
  const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1);
  const dLon = toRad(lon2 - lon1);

  const a =
    Math.sin(dLat / 2) * Math.sin(dLat / 2) +
    Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) *
      Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) *
      Math.sin(dLon / 2) *
      Math.sin(dLon / 2);

  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));
  return R * c;
}

function startRun() {
  totalDistance = 0;
  lastPosition = null;

  watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(
    (pos) => {
      const { latitude, longitude } = pos.coords;

      if (lastPosition) {
        totalDistance += haversine(
          lastPosition.lat,
          lastPosition.lon,
          latitude,
          longitude
        );
      }

      lastPosition = { lat: latitude, lon: longitude };

      console.log(`Distance: ${(totalDistance / 1609.34).toFixed(2)} mi`);

      if (totalDistance >= 1609.34) {
        console.log("✅ 1 mile complete!");
        navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchId);
      }
    },
    (err) => console.error(err),
    { enableHighAccuracy: true, maximumAge: 1000, timeout: 10000 }
  );
}

function stopRun() {
  if (watchId) navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchId);
}
```

---

## 🔐 Extra Safeguards

* **Accuracy filter:** Ignore points with low accuracy (e.g., `pos.coords.accuracy > 30m`).
* **Speed plausibility:** Reject jumps that imply impossible speeds (e.g., > 20 mph).
* **Resume support:** Save distance + lastPosition to `localStorage` in case of accidental refresh.

---

👉 Do you want me to extend this into a **React hook** (so you can plug it straight into your Murph workout app), or keep it as plain JS utilities?


Nice — you’re basically sketching out the **social + fitness tracking flow** of the app. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ve got and what’s worth adding 👇

---

## 📱 Core Pages / Views

### 1. **Auth**

* `Login / Signup`
* `Forgot Password` (optional, but nice to have)
* Social login? (Google/Apple) if you want lower friction

---

### 2. **Feed**

* **Global Feed** 🌍 (all users’ Murph logs; can be disabled if traffic is huge)
* **Following Feed** 👥 (only workouts from people I follow)

💡 You can A/B test **“Follow system” vs “Mutual Friends”**:

* **Follow model (like Twitter/Strava):** One-way, lower friction, better for scale.
* **Friend confirm (like FB):** Two-way, better for small close-knit communities.
  👉 I’d start with **Follow-based**, easier to implement, and fits fitness apps.

---

### 3. **Profile**

* **My Profile (private view)**

  * Total Murphs logged
  * Total pull-ups / push-ups / squats done
  * Average Murph time
  * Best Murph time
  * History chart (timeline graph of Murph times)
* **Other User Profile (public view)**

  * Show their Murph logs (or at least summary)
  * Option to follow/unfollow

---

### 4. **Workout Logging**

* “Start Murph” → tracks reps & runs
* Option to save incomplete attempt
* After saving → show summary + “share to feed”

---

### 5. **Search & Discovery**

* Search users by name/username
* See suggested athletes (most active, near your location, etc.)
* Quick action: Follow from search results

---

### 6. **Analytics / Insights**

* Charts:

  * Murph completion times over time 📈
  * Volume totals (pull-ups, push-ups, squats)
  * PR tracking (fastest Murph)
* Maybe achievements/badges (e.g., “10 Murphs Club”)

---

### 7. **Settings**

* Edit profile (name, username, profile pic)
* Manage privacy (public/private account, who can see feed)
* Notification settings

---

## 🏗 Suggested Structure (routes-ish)

```
/login
/signup
/feed              // global or segmented tabs (Global | Following)
/workout/new       // start or log a Murph
/workout/:id       // detail view of one logged workout
/profile/me        // my private profile
/profile/:username // public profile
/search            // find friends
/settings
```

---

## 🌟 Optional / Nice-to-Haves

* **Challenges page:** monthly challenges, leaderboards, etc.
* **Badges page:** achievements (streaks, PRs, volume milestones).
* **Events:** local/global Murph day logs (like Memorial Day Murph).

---

👉 My take: start **lean** — Feed (global + following), My Profile, Log Workout, Search, and Public Profiles. Add analytics + achievements once people are actually logging workouts.

---

Do you want me to sketch **database tables/relations** for this structure (users, workouts, follows, feed)? That’ll make it crystal clear how to implement.


# TODO
- drizzle-zod
- setup better id rather than auto inc
- persist murph when refresh or exiting app
- run murph without account
- user public profile
- click on murph item to view user
- global murphs infinite query
- search for users
- invite users
- badges
